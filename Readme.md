## Introduction

Provide a brief overview of your project, its purpose, and any other relevant context.

- Internet connection (for downloading Docker images).

## Getting Started

### Installing Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, you can download and install it from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Setting Up MongoDB

To run the MongoDB database in a Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example mongo
```


Build the Docker image for the Node.js application:
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

Run the Node.js application:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-app -p 8080:3000 my-node-app

```
